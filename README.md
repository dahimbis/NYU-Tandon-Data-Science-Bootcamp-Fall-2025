## ðŸŽ¬ Final Project: Movie Recommendation System
Together with my team, our final project involves developing a movie recommendation system using the TMDB 5000 movie dataset.  
The project combines **demographic**, **content-based**, and **collaborative filtering** techniques to suggest personalized movies.  
We will perform data cleaning, feature analysis, and model evaluation to improve recommendation accuracy.  
This project highlights the use of machine learning for personalized content discovery.
